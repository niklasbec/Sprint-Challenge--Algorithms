"""
This sounds like bubble sorting so thats the approach I am going to take
So what I need to do is start the robot at index 0

Then I tell him to compare the current index with the one to the right
If the index on the right is a lower value, swap the values and move to the right
If the Index on the right is a higher value or the same just move right
I repeat this over and over till he reaches the end of the list
I need to tell him to go all the way back to index 0 afterwards
If there is one run without a swap the list is sorted I can probably check that with the light
So light should start as off and whenever it makes a swap it gets turned on
At the end of the list check the light, if its on we need another run, if its off were done

Edit: Yeah.... did not end up doing that.
